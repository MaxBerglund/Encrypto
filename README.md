# Encrypto 1.0
Encrypto is an encryption tool developed in Java by Max Berglund, Abood Aldaker and Daniel Ã–hman.

**How to use:**
To use the main Encrypto interface, run the Main.java file located in the src folder. To use another implementation with a terminal interface, run Encrypto.java. If you want to use Encrypto in order to encrypt images, run ImageEncrypto.java.



Overview:
-------------------------------------
We plan to create a tool that encrypts and decrypts text according to some encyption algorithm, perhaps Data Encryption Standard (DES) which is a symmetric encryption algoritm, which means that is uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. Use of DES begun in 1977, but it is no longer used because of its security vulnerabilities. This makes it a decent size project for us to implement, and perhaps give us the possibility to start learn about realistic ways to crack the encryption without the key. Minimally Viable Product (MVP): https://encode-decode.com/des-encrypt-online/

We have some additional features and goals which we might implement if there is additional time and effort available:
1. Make a GUI interface for Encrypto, using some sort of Framework (probably JavaSwing).
2. A method to encrypt files of different types instead of just strings, like image or PDF encryption.
3. An AI bot that attempts to decrypt an encrypted message without access to the key using different cryptanalysis techniques. Inspiration 1: https://blog.daisie.com/cryptanalysis-techniques-beginners-guide-tips/#brute-force-technique 



Plan for development:
---------------------
The first thing that we need to do is to really understand how the DES encryption algorithm works. Once we have done that, we need to decide on how we will organise our files and setup the project.

We plan to divide the project up into a number of branches:

  1. **String Format Function** This function takes in a string and turns it into binary and divides it into 64-bit blocks so that the several 64-length arrays are ready for input into the Encrypto Machine. It therefore returns an array of arrays containing 64 ints and each int is 1 digit of the binary string. The last part is filled with zero.

  2. **Permutation Functions** This function takes in a 64-length array of ints and swaps all elements according to the the Initial Permutation tabel (IP). It then returns this permuted version of the array. This branch will consists of both the initial and final Permutation functions. The final permutation function also turns its output into hexadecimal.

  3. **Encrypto Machine** This will probably be the largest branch, and it will include the main encryption process that runs 16 iterations and performs the key transformation, expansion permutation, S-box permutation, P-box permutation and the XOR&Swap. We plan to divide these parts into sub-branches for this branch.

      1. *Key Transformation* The initial key is turned into hexadecimal, then converted into a 64-bit binary string that is stored as a 64-length array of ints where each int is a digit of the binary string. Then the binary version is transformed into a 56-length array key by discarding every 8th bit of the initial key while permutating over the PC-1 table. Then there are 16 rounds run of a process that generates 16 new 48-length array subkeys, one for each round. The PC-1 permutated key is divided into two 28-length array halves, C and D, These halves are both circularly shifted left by one or two positions depending on which round it is. One shift if round number is 1, 2, 9 or 16. Two shifts otherwise. For the first round, we get the two partial keys C1 and D1 that have both been left shifted once. We should combine these two into one key again, C1D1, and permutate over it according to the PC-2 table. The result of that permutation gives us the first subkey, K1! Then we do that for each round to get all of the 16 different subkeys that are each 48-length arrays.
    
      2. *Expansion Permutation* The received input from the initial permutation, that is a 64-length array, is divided into two 32-length halves, left L and right R. Then for each round, an recursive function is run. For round n, the left Ln is made from using the previous right Rn-1, and the right Rn is made from using the previous left Ln-1 and the output of a function f (with the inputs Rn-1 and a key Kn). The function f expands its input (Rn-1) to a 48-length array using a "E BIT-selection table" that repeats some of the bits, let's call this expanded version En. The next step of the function is an XOR Swap between En and the key Kn which is done using the XOR Swap Function. The result of this is run through the S-box Permutation and the output of that is the output of the function is permuted according to the P-box. Then we finally calculate Rn by performing another XOR Swap between these two parts (Ln-1 and the function output). Let us call the result of this "EPn". The EPn is the output of the Expansion Permutation for round n, and it is then used as input into the next round in order to create EPn+1 until it is the last round.
    
      3. *S-box Permutation* The output of the Expansion Permutation for round n: EPn, is a 48-length array of ints that are either 0 or 1. For the S-box Permutation, this array is divided up into 8 arrays that are each 6-length by making the first 6th elements of the EPn into B1, the 7-13th elements into B2, ..., up to Bn which is the last 6 elements of the EPn. The next step is to compute each B through each S-box. There are 8 S-box tables that each have 16 columns and 4 rows, and it is important that these columns/rows are zero-indexed. Sn is the S-box for round n. To compute Bn using Sn, the first and last elements of Bn are selected and combined into a binary number which can be either 0 (00), 1 (01), 2 (10) or 3 (11). The number that it is gets used to select the row of the S-box Sn. Then the remaining middle 4 elements of Bn are combined and evaluated as a binary number in the same way, and it can have the value 0-15. The value of those 4 middle elements determine the column which should be picked. The number in the S-box which lies in the row and column that have been selected is converted into its equivalent 4-digit binary to become Sn(Bn). Finally, each Sn(Bn) is combined into an 32-length array of ints, let us call it S. S is then simply permutated according to the P-box table. If the number that is in the first position of the P-box table is 27, then the 27:th element of S is put in the first position of a new array of ints. This is done for all elements in S and this is the output of the S-box Permutation.
    
      4. *XOR Swap Function* This function takes two same-length arrays of int and compares and adjusts each element according to the XOR logical operation "Either or...". This is done twice for each round during the Expansion Permutation.
