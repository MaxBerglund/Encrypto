# Encrypto
Encrypto is an encryption tool developed by Max Berglund and Abood Aldaker.



Planning before starting the project:

We plan to create a tool that encrypts and decrypts text according to some encyption algorithm, perhaps Data Encryption Standard (DES) which is a symmetric encryption algoritm, which means that is uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. More information on DES: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-encryption-standard-des-set-1/ 

We have some additional features and goals which we might implement if there is time and effort available:
1. A method to encrypt files of different types instead of just strings, like PDF encryption.
2. An AI bot that attempts to decrypt an encrypted message without access to the key using different cryptanalysis techniques.
